## Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

Currently I am participating the [Data Scientist Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025) programm at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). The first goal of the course was to work with a dataset of your choice. It was a good exercise to get better at using Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. At the end you had to formulate 3-5 business questions whose answers you took from the dataset. I decided to work with the dataset [Boston Airbnb Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). The dataset is a good choice for beginners and contains some interesting correlations.

## About the Dataset <a name="data"></a>

The dataset consists of 3 files: calendar.csv, listings.csv and reviews.csv. Within the framework of this project I decided to work only with listings.csv. The file does have a size of 3585 rows and 95 columns.

## Results <a name="results"></a>

The aim was to answer at least 3 business questions concerning the dataset. Following questions were of interest:

1. Which property type is listed most often and which has the highest average price?
2. What are the most expensive neighbourhoods and what is the distribution per neighbourhood in terms of price?
3. Is it possible to create a model that gives an indication of the price with the right input data?

The main findings of the results can be found here.
